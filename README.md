# data-processing

  a simple python script to edit your images mainly for deep learning
  
  the current main features of the processing are :  
         1) reshaping the images to a given size  
         2) applying filters:  
            - gray scale filter  
            - CLAHE (contrast filter)  
            - hope to add more features as we go and feel free to add features as you find fit :)  

## added a sample-data folder with 2 png images for experimenting
